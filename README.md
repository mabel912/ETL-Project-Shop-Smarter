# Team 5 ELT Project- Shop Smarter

Team 5 chose a project that would examine the prices of a set list of items and compare these items across various zip codes across
the United States.  We would like to find if there are differences in prices based on location and look into the impact of product reviews. 
We have randomly selected five zipcodes in five different states (Alaska, Virginia, California, Florida, and Texas).  A random list of
items will be used to compare among the desginated stores.

### Purpose of the Analysis

* The primary purpose is to examine if a relationship exists between product price and location (zipcode) of Walmart stores.
